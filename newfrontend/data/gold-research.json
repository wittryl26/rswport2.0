      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "This case study applies the scientific method to financial analysis, using empirical observations to explore gold market dynamics. It began with noting increased gold smuggling in India, coinciding with gold prices rising for three days straight on March 5, 2025, due to a weakening US dollar and trade tensions, as Saumil Gandhi of HDFC Securities noted. The goal is to identify underlying drivers and investment implications."

      "title": "Observation",
      "content": "Over the past week, India reported multiple gold smuggling incidents, including 5 kilograms seized at Mumbai Airport, 10 kilograms near the India-Nepal border, and a significant haul at Chennai port. This uptick, beyond typical patterns tied to high import duties, suggests shifting market conditions warranting further investigation."
