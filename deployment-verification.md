# Deployment Verification Checklist

## Initial Deployment Verification

- [x] Build completed successfully
- [x] Dependencies installed correctly
- [x] API routes configured properly

## Testing Points

### Frontend
- [ ] Visit the main URL to confirm the frontend loads
- [ ] Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- [ ] Test responsiveness on mobile devices

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Test `/api/health` endpoint (should return JSON with status and timestamp)
  ```
  curl https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/health
  ```
- [ ] Test `/api/gold-inr-data` endpoint
  ```
  curl https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/gold-inr-data
  ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 404 Not Found on Frontend
If your frontend shows 404 Not Found:
1. Check that your Frontend directory contains an index.html file
2. Verify the routes in vercel.json are correctly pointing to Frontend
3. Ensure that any links in the HTML files use relative paths

### API Endpoint Not Found
If API endpoints return 404:
1. Confirm API functions exist in the /api directory
2. Check that the API routes are properly defined in vercel.json
3. Verify the API functions are exported properly (using module.exports)

### Internal Server Error (500)
1. Check the function logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set up
3. Look for syntax errors or runtime exceptions in your code

## Next Steps

1. Set up a custom domain if needed
2. Configure environment variables for production
3. Set up monitoring and analytics
